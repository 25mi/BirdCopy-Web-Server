## Image URLs and Image Sizes

You'll find the URLs to the image(s) for a photo in the `images` field in the returned JSON for a photo.  The images provided with our standard API access will be watermarked with the 500px logo and attribution. For non-watermarked images please contact sales@500px.com

**Important** - You must not alter the URLs returned by the API in any way.  Altered URLs will be rejected by our system when the image is loaded.  Instead, please use the `image_size` parameter to request the sizes your application needs.

500px has a number of preset image sizes.  Most API requests that return image URLs can be instructed to return the URLs for one or more specific sizes.  To retrieve the URL for a specific image size, include that size's ID in the query string of the request, using the `image_size` parameter:

```
GET /v1/photos?feature=popular&image_size=3
```

If you want to request multiple sizes, you can pass an array for `image_size` as well:
```
GET /v1/photos?feature=popular&image_size[]=3&image_size[]=2
```

These are the standard cropped sizes:
<table id="image_sizes">
  <tr>
    <th>ID</th>
    <th>Dimensions</th>
  </tr>
  <tr><td>1</td><td>70px x 70px</td></tr>
  <tr><td>2</td><td>140px x 140px</td></tr>

  <tr><td>440</td><td>440px x 440px</td></tr>
  <tr><td>600</td><td>600px x 600px</td></tr>
</table>

These are the standard uncropped sizes:
